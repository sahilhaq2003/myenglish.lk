# ✅ COMPLETE: Courses Page Styling Updates

## 🎨 **Visual Refinements**

I have updated the **Courses Page** (`/courses`) based on your specific requests to improve the aesthetic.

### 1. **Search Bar Color Update**
   - **Removed Green:** The search bar no longer uses the default "primary" green color.
   - **New Look:** It now glows with a professional **Indigo** (`#6366f1`) color when clicked or focused, matching the premium theme of the page.

### 2. **Removed Course Prices**
   - **Cleaner Cards:** I have completely removed the price tags (e.g., "$49.99" or "FREE") from all course cards.
   - **Focus on Content:** The cards now focus purely on the Course Title, Rating, and Category, providing a cleaner and more distinct look.

## 🛠️ **Files Modified**
- `components/CoursesPage.tsx`

## 🧪 **Check It Out**
1.  Go to: `http://localhost:3002/courses`
2.  **Click the Search Bar:** Notice it now highlights in **Indigo/Blue**, not Green.
3.  **Look at Cards:** No price tags are visible on the course images.

The page is now cleaner and styled exactly as requested! ✨
