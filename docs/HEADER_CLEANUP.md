# ✅ FIXED: Dashboard Header Cleanup

## 🧹 **Interface Update**

I have removed the **"Streak"** and **"XP"** status icons from the top of the **Dashboard**.

- **Previous Behavior:** Displayed "12 DAY STREAK" and "1250 XP" near the Profile icon.
- **New Behavior:** These badges are now gone, providing a cleaner, more minimalist header.

## 🛠️ **File Modified**
- `App.tsx` (DashboardLayout header section)

## 🧪 **Verify Now**
1.  Go to your **Dashboard**.
2.  Look at the top-right header area.
3.  You should ONLY see the **Theme Toggle** (Sun/Moon) and your **Profile Picture**.

The header is now cleaner! ✨
