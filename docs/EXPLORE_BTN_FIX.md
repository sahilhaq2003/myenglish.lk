# ✅ FIXED: Dashboard Explore Button

## 🎯 **Navigation Update**

I have updated the **"Explore Courses"** button that appears when you have no enrolled courses (Empty State).

- **Previous Behavior:** Scrolled to the courses section on the Home Page.
- **New Behavior:** Navigates directly to the dedicated **Courses Page** (`/courses`).

## 🛠️ **File Modified**
- `App.tsx`

## 🧪 **Verify Now**
1.  Go to your Dashboard (ensure you are logged in).
2.  If you have no enrolled courses (or see the "Explore Courses" button), click it.
3.  You will be redirected to `http://localhost:3002/courses`.

Navigation is now consistent across the dashboard! 🚀
