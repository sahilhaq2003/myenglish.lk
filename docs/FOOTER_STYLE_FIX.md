# ✅ FIXED: Footer Styling

## 🎯 **Completion of Styling Updates**

I have removed the green background from the **social media icons** in the footer.

- **Previous Issue:** The social icons (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) had a green background (`bg-secondary`).
- **Fix Applied:** Changed to a neutral **Gray/Dark Gray** (`bg-gray-100` / `dark:bg-zinc-800`).

## 🎨 **Consistency Reached**
Now, multiple green elements across the site have been neutralized to match your premium blue/indigo theme:
1.  **Search Bar** (Courses Page) ✅
2.  **Course Info Tags** (Lessons/Weeks) ✅
3.  **Footer Icons** (Social Media) ✅

## 🧪 **Verify Now**
1.  Scroll to the bottom of any page.
2.  Check the 4 circular icons.
3.  They should be **Light Gray** (in light mode) or **Dark Gray** (in dark mode), and turn **Indigo** on hover.

The user interface is now cleaner and fully aligned with your color preferences! 🎨
