## 📚 EXAMPLE LESSON FLOW

### Lesson: "Present Simple Tense"

**AI Teacher starts:**
> "Hello! I'm your English teacher for today. We're going to learn about the Present Simple Tense. This is a really important grammar topic! Are you ready to begin?"

**Student:** "Yes, I'm ready!"

**AI Teacher:**
> "Wonderful! So, the Present Simple is used for habits and routines. For example, 'I wake up at 7 AM every day.' Can you tell me one thing you do every day?"

**Student:** "I go to work at 8 o'clock."

**AI Teacher:**
> "Excellent! That's a perfect example of Present Simple. Now, let me ask you - how do we make the negative form? For example, 'I don't work on Sundays.'"
