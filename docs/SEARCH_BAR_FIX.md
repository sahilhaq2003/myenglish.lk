# ✅ FIXED: Search Bar Color

## 🎯 **Corrected Visual Style**

I have removed the unwanted green background from the **Courses Search Bar**.

- **Previous Issue:** The search bar was using the `secondary` theme color, which is configured as **Green** in your theme settings (`theme.css`).
- **Fix Applied:** I changed the background to a neutral **Gray** (`bg-gray-100` / `dark:bg-zinc-800`).

## 🎨 **New Look**
- **Default State:** Clean, neutral gray background.
- **Focus State:** White/dark background with an **Indigo** border glow.
- **Icon:** Indigo colored search icon on interaction.

## 🧪 **Verify Now**
1.  Go to `http://localhost:3002/courses`
2.  Refresh the page if needed.
3.  The search bar should now be **Gray/Neutral**, NOT Green.

Styling is now fully consistent with the premium dashboard theme! 🎨
