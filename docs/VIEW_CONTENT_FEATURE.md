# ✅ FIXED: Course Content Preview

## 👁️ **New Feature: View Content**

I have added a **"View Content"** button to every course card in the **Courses Page**.

- **Functionality:**
    - Allows you to see the **Course Details** (Modules, Lessons, Duration) **before** enrolling.
    - Clicking it navigates to the detailed course view.
    - Users can now browse the curriculum without committing to enroll immediately.

## 🛠️ **File Modified**
- `components/CoursesPage.tsx`: Added a secondary action button for non-enrolled courses.

## 🧪 **Verify Now**
1.  Go to **Explore Courses**.
2.  Find a course you haven't enrolled in yet.
3.  Click the **"View Content"** button.
4.  You will be taken to the detailed breakdown of what's inside! 📄
