## ⏱️ **NEW: Time & Progress Tracking**

I have upgraded the "Virtual Classroom" to include real-time progress tracking, so you can see exactly how far along you are in the lesson.

## ✨ **NEW FEATURES**

### 1. **Live Lesson Timer**
   - **Real-Time Clock:** A digital timer (e.g., `05:30`) now appears in the top-right corner of the classroom.
   - **Seconds Tracking:** Updates every second for precision.
   - **Uses:** Helps you pace yourself during the 20-minute AI lecture.

### 2. **Progress Bar**
   - **Visual Bar:** A sleek gradient progress bar fills up as the lesson continues.
   - **Percentage:** Shows exact completion % (e.g., **"25% Complete"**).
   - **Calculation:** Automatically calculated based on the lesson's estimated duration (e.g., 20 mins).

### 3. **AI Awareness**
   - The AI knows the lesson duration and will pace the lecture to fit the time.
   - Typically targets a comprehensive **20-minute flow**.

## 🚀 **HOW IT WORKS**

2.  **Watch Timer:** The clock starts running immediately.
3.  **Track Progress:** The bar fills up as you listen and learn.
4.  **Finish:** When the bar hits 100%, you've completed the recommended learning time!
